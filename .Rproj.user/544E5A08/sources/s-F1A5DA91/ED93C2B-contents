\title{Fit a beta model with the case/control covariate and record the coefficient's p-value}
\description{Given two vectors of beta numbers for cases and controls, beta_p() fits a beta model with the case/control covariate and records the coefficient's p-value. The case and control groups do not have to be of equal size. Outputs a numeric p-value.
}
\usage{
beta_p(case, control)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{case}{a vector of beta numbers for the case group.
}
\item{control}{a vector of beta numbers for the control group.
}
}
\examples{
#Calculate the p-value of the case/control covariate's coefficient
beta_p_value <- beta_p(case=c(0.1,0.12,0.2,0.25,0.26),control=c(0.03,0.04,0.05,0.08,0.1))
